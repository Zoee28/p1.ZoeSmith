# Issues with current design of microwave:
- Cook and power button not functioning
- Limited to preprogrammed buttons (ex. pizza, express cook, add 30 seconds)
- Preprogrammed food times not accurate (ex. For pizza when I use the pizza button, my pizza is still cold or only room temperature for 1 slice)
- For inputting 1:15, the user must press 1 minute, add 30 seconds, and manually stop at 15 seconds remaining
- Smooth surface throughout (for visual impaired users, they are unable to distingust where buttons are)

# Common uses for Microwave
- Heat up food
-	Cook popcorn
-	Frozen dinners
-	Heat water for hot beverages (ex. Hot chocolate or tea)
-	Melt butter/chocolate

# Rare uses for Microwave
-	Use 4-6 automatic buttons
-	Thaw meat
-	Use frozen dinner function
-	Use popcorn function (popcorn bags tell you not to use microwave function)
-	Cook by weight

# Common sequence of actions:
1.	Push door open button
2.	Place food inside
3.	Close microwave door
4.	Use express cook buttons OR
a.	Press timer
b.	Enter in time 
c.	Press start
5.	Wait for microwave to beep
6.	Press door open 
7.	Grab food out of microwave
8.	Close door
9.	Press cancel or clear if stopped before time ended 

# How does the microwave's interface help the user figure out how it works?
-	The express cook buttons make it easy to cook something for 1-6 minutes with a press of a single button. 
-	The numbers 0-9 help the user to understand to input a time
-	Start and cancel buttons tell the user how to start and stop the cooking. 

# How do microwaves provide feedback to users?
-	The LED displays tells the user the current time by clock function
-	The LED displays tells the user how much time is left in cooking
-	When the timer is done, the microwave beeps
-	When the microwave is in use, the light is on inside and rotates the food
-	The microwave beeps when you press any button

# Common mistakes
-	A user tries to input 1:15 by pressing the 1 button and it automatically starts cooking 1 minute
-	Pressing the preprogrammed times (ex. Microwave) makes you think it will act like the express cook buttons and automatically start cooking, however you have to press start.
-	The cook button does not work on the microwave and just beeps twice 
-	If the microwave is stopped and the user forgets to press cancel to return to clock, the user can mistake the time left as the current time
-	The preprogrammed buttons are not universal. (ex. For 1 brand of popcorn, the microwave function is the perfect time. However, another brand I buy takes 3.5 minutes to cook)
-	People unfamiliar with microwaves that do not have a handle on door will be unfamiliar on how to open the microwave

# New Design
![New Project](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74264662/109454979-2b0e5f80-7a1b-11eb-9f80-b42c37af8471.jpg)
- 2 ways to open microwave door (handle located on door or door release button located on bottom right)
- Placed clock and timer buttons closer to LED display
- Placed cook button with numbered buttons
- Letters and numbers on buttons are beveled to easier tell 
- Brush to feel, hard tap to input
- Voice on/off button (verbally says what buttons are pressed)
- Speak button (User can press and hold button to hold to tell how long and what power to cook food for)
- Removed inaccurate auto programmed food buttons

# Future improvements
- Bluetooth connectivity to send alert to phone, smart watch, or fitbit that food is ready (helps with hearing impaired users, or users who are in time crunch with tasks).
